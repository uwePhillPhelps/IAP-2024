### Unit Test assessments

Certain exercises in the tutorials are important milestones along your journey learning C++ and will be assessed. Aserve can automatically test your iapProj programs for certain tutorial exercises to see if your solution responds in the expected way. Check the following link for more info.

# Aserve application

This is a light weight audio client-server application with basic audio generating functions as well as providing MIDI input/output for control.

# iapProj code

Your will write all of your code for tutorials in a project called `iapProj` which includes everything needed to control and co-operate with Aserve. See the <a href="Tutorials/Workshop%201.md">workshop materials</a> for more information on how Aserve and iapProj work together with your code acting as a 'decision maker' for how Aserve responds to key presses etc.

# ...and beyond!

Read the following <a href="Tutorials/Working%20on%20your%20own%20machine.md">guide</a> to set up your own machine for working off-campus. Instructions for using Microsoft Windows and Visual Studio as well as Apple MacOS and Xcode are provided separately (see also the [windows branch](../../tree/windows) of this repository). Video guides are included.

Development environments such as Visual Studio and Xcode are fairly heavy in terms of storage requirements **we strongly recommend working with the lab machines, as these are ready to roll and require barely more than logging in to get started** 😊👍

A python front end for the project can be found here:
